# github-function-test

To test how branch, fork, etc. works.

1. In branch-dragonpw now, added this new line by dragonpw.

2. In master branch now. Directly change and update to the online repository.

3. There are 3 kinds of control
   A. from the github.com UI.
   B. using github desktop.
   C. using github command line.

4. This is in the branch "interesting"

5. This is also in the branch "interesting"

6. Summary.  There is no need to use pull request if you are controlling your own repository with command line. However, you need it if you use online or desktop github. It is just doing the same thing as merge and push.
Commit is just committing to local repo. You need the sync in the desktop UI or call push in the shell.

7. Alright, in current desktop github, you can use compare to merge. No need to "pull-request" to merge.

8. You can only request pull after forking the other's repository. By ytsr1988 in a forked branch.
